# PoliticalIdeologyCalculator
This repo houses the code for the website Political Ideology Calculator. This website allows users to experiment with a slider to dictate values of different political axis and see which ideology that produces. This is the learning experience for Caleb Copley as he experiments with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
