# PoliticalIdeologyCalculator

This repo houses the code for the website Political Ideology Calculator. This website allows users to experiment with a slider to dictate values of different political axis and see which ideology that produces. Afterwards, the user can click the "Calculate" button and generate an all encompassing ideology that combines the five individual ideologies. This is the learning experience for Caleb Copley as he experiments with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
